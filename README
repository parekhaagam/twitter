We have now seperated auth code and tweet/post code by making seperate servers

To run the project run the below command
<Windows>
start_server.cmd

<LINUX>
sh start_server.sh --> this will start auth, storage and web servers at localhost:9000, localhost:9002 and
localhost:8090 respectively.
This command will host a webpage on http://localhost:8090/twitter endpoint
